<p>This project is inspired from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CityNerd">CityNerd Youtube channel</a> and focuses on farebox recovery - the percentage of a transit system’s revenue that comes from fares instead of taxes. The data for this analysis comes from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a>(NTD). This mini-project analyzes farebox revenues, total trips, vehicle miles traveled and operating expenses for public transit systems in the U.S. in 2022.</p>
<p>Key data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue Table</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Latest Monthly Ridership Tables</a></p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-1.-data-downloading-cleaning">Part 1. Data Downloading &amp; Cleaning</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse">tidyverse</a> package, as it provides useful data manipulation tools such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>dplyr</code> for data manipulation functions (e.g.<code>mutate()</code>, <code>select()</code>, <code>group_by()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>ggplot2</code> for data visualization (e.g.&nbsp;bar charts, line charts, scatter plots)</p></li>
<li><p><code>readr</code> for reading and writing data (e.g.<code>read_csv()</code>, <code>write_csv()</code>)</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="a-fare-revenue-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-fare-revenue-data">a) Fare Revenue Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>This dataset contains information on the total fare revenues for transit agencies. All files in downloading steps are taken directly from the official website. After the <code>FARES</code> data is cleaned, only important columns are selected and data is filtered by the rows where <code>Expense Type</code> is <code>Funds Earned During Period</code>.</li>

<p>The metric of Unlinked Passengers Trips or UPT provides insight into how many time passengers boarded a transit vehicle. The high UPT equals to more frequent trips. To filter the busiest system, we set 400,000 UPT at least in 2022 and sorted by the highest total.</p>

<p>The <strong>most efficient transit system</strong> depends on whether the focus is on revenue generation, operational costs, or the balance of both.</p>
<p>From a cost-efficiency perspective, the <strong>Port Imperial Ferry</strong> stands out for farebox recovery, while <strong>Metropolitan Vanpool</strong> and <strong>North Carolina Transit (Bus)</strong> are operationally efficient in terms of expenses. However, if revenue generation per trips or miles is prioritized, <strong>Hampton Jitney</strong> and <strong>Jacksonville Ferry</strong> are the best.</p>
